# Challenge 1 - Code Refactor

# Description

For this first challenge, our objective was to take a webpage's HTML and CSS code and refactor it with a specific focus on utilizing Semantic HTML elements wherever possible and to consdolidate the CSS to be more accesible and organized. I did this by breaking down the HTML elements I was familiar with and finding suitable Semantic replacements. I then reorganized the style sheet to follow the flow of the deployed page. I also added in alt attributes to the img tags so as to increase the accesibility of those elements.
